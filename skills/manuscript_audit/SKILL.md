name: manuscript-audit
description: "Audit and polish scientific manuscripts for journal submission. Use this skill whenever the user has a manuscript draft (docx, pdf, or pasted text) for peer review. The skill performs four passes: (1) extracts all author-year citations and verifies claims against original PDFs in the user's Zotero library to ensure faithfulness, consulting the manuscript's reference list to disambiguate author-year citations; (2) identifies unsupported or weakly supported claims and suggests additional citations via semantic search of the library; (3) checks for logical inconsistencies, contradictions, and reasoning gaps within the manuscript; (4) copyedits for grammar, style, punctuation, flow, and journal conventions. Trigger on phrases like 'audit my manuscript,' 'review my citations,' 'fact-check my claims,' 'check my paper,' or 'prepare for submission.' (Claude Code only — uses litmap for semantic citation-gap detection.)"
compatibility: "Claude Code only. Requires zotero skill, pdf-reading skill, file-reading skill (if manuscript uploaded as file), and a working `uv run litmap` install at ~/src/Cowork/litmap."

# Manuscript Audit for Scientific Journal Submission

> ⚠️ **Runtime: Claude Code only.** This skill calls `uv run litmap …` against `~/LitLake/embeddings.db` on the local machine. It will not work in the Cowork web sandbox. If you reached this skill from the Cowork web frontend, stop and switch to Claude Code.

A four-stage workflow to verify citations against sources, identify evidence gaps, detect logical flaws, and polish a manuscript draft before submission.

---

## Stage 1: Citation Extraction & Faithfulness Audit

### Input
- Manuscript (docx, pdf, or pasted text)
- User's Zotero library (via zotero skill)

### Process

1. **Extract reference list:** Locate the References or Bibliography section in the manuscript. Build a lookup table: `author_year → [full citation text, DOI/URL if present]`.

2. **Extract in-text citations:** Use regex to find all author-year patterns:
   - `Smith 2020`
   - `(Jones et al. 2019)`
   - `Smith and Brown 2018`
   - `(Smith 2020; Brown 2021)`
   
   For each citation, record: the matched text, the sentence/paragraph context, the section heading, and the claim being supported.

3. **Disambiguate via reference list:** For each in-text citation, match it to the reference list entry to confirm author names, year, and full publication details. Flag any mismatches (e.g., cited as "Smith 2020" but reference list shows "Smith, J. 2019").

4. **Check for retracted papers (Zotero 9):** Before opening any PDFs, query the `retractedItems` table for every paper matched in the database:

   ```python
   retracted = {
       r[0]: r[1]
       for r in conn.execute("SELECT itemID, data FROM retractedItems").fetchall()
   }
   ```

   If any cited paper's itemID appears in `retracted`, flag it at the very top of the Stage 1 report with a ⛔ **RETRACTED** verdict and the retraction data (journal notice, date if available). The author must address this before submission — retracted papers should not be cited without explicit acknowledgement of retraction status.

4b. **Locate PDFs in Zotero:** Query the Zotero SQLite database directly rather than grepping filenames. Filename-based search is unreliable for two reasons: (a) auto-generated filenames may not include the author name at all (e.g., an organisation such as "Nature Positive Initiative" may be saved under the document title), and (b) overly broad filename patterns return hundreds of false positives, making truncation errors likely. Instead, run a Python query against `zotero.sqlite`:

   ```python
   import sqlite3
   conn = sqlite3.connect('/mnt/Zotero/zotero.sqlite')
   query = '''
   SELECT i.key, c.lastName, c.firstName, idv_year.value AS year,
          idv_title.value AS title, ia.path
   FROM items i
   JOIN itemCreators ic ON ic.itemID = i.itemID AND ic.orderIndex = 0
   JOIN creators c ON c.creatorID = ic.creatorID
   LEFT JOIN itemData id_year ON id_year.itemID = i.itemID
       AND id_year.fieldID = (SELECT fieldID FROM fields WHERE fieldName = 'date')
   LEFT JOIN itemDataValues idv_year ON idv_year.valueID = id_year.valueID
   LEFT JOIN itemData id_title ON id_title.itemID = i.itemID
       AND id_title.fieldID = (SELECT fieldID FROM fields WHERE fieldName = 'title')
   LEFT JOIN itemDataValues idv_title ON idv_title.valueID = id_title.valueID
   LEFT JOIN itemAttachments ia ON ia.parentItemID = i.itemID
   WHERE c.lastName LIKE ? AND idv_year.value LIKE ?
   '''
   results = conn.execute(query, ('%He%', '2015%')).fetchall()
   ```

   Substitute the author's last name and year from the reference list. For multi-word organisation names (e.g. "Nature Positive Initiative"), search by the first distinctive word as `lastName LIKE '%Nature Positive%'` or search by title keywords instead. The `path` field returned is of the form `storage:filename.pdf`; prepend `/mnt/Zotero/storage/<key>/` using the item key to get the full path. If multiple results are returned for the same author+year, use the title from the reference list entry to select the correct one.

   **Important:** Zotero PDF filenames are generated automatically and may contain errors — misspelled author names, wrong years, truncated titles. Never use a filename mismatch as evidence of a citation error in the manuscript. Always resolve ambiguity by matching against the full reference list entry (title, journal, DOI), not the filename alone.

4c. **Check for reading notes:** Once a Zotero item is matched, query any attached reading notes as a secondary source before opening the PDF:

   ```python
   from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

   notes = conn.execute(
       "SELECT note FROM itemNotes WHERE parentItemID = ?",
       (matched_item_id,)
   ).fetchall()

   for (note_html,) in notes:
       soup = BeautifulSoup(note_html, 'html.parser')
       hr = soup.find('hr')
       if hr:
           summary_text = ' '.join(t.get_text() for t in hr.previous_siblings)
           dy_text = ' '.join(t.get_text() for t in hr.next_siblings)
       else:
           summary_text = soup.get_text()
           dy_text = ''
   ```

   Use **PDF summary sections** (content before `<hr/>`) to quickly locate passages relevant to the claim — they save time when skimming a long PDF. Treat as helpful but non-authoritative; always confirm any finding against the PDF itself.

   Use **DY sections** (content after `<hr/>`) as context only for understanding how the paper was intended to be used. Never cite DY content in a faithfulness verdict.

   In the Stage 1 output, add a Notes subsection where reading notes exist:

   ```
   Notes (Zotero reading notes — secondary source, verify against PDF):
     [Relevant excerpt from PDF summary section]

   DY context (personal use-case notes — not a faithfulness source):
     [Relevant excerpt from DY section, if any]
   ```

5. **Extract and verify:** For each PDF found:
   - Extract full text using pdf-reading skill
   - Search for keywords from the claim (nouns, key concepts)
   - Extract relevant passages (context: 2–3 sentences before/after the keyword)
   - Compare the claim in the manuscript to the passage in the PDF
   - Record verdict: ✓ **Faithful** (claim matches source), ⚠ **Overstated** (claim goes beyond source), ✗ **Unsupported** (no matching passage found), or **Partial** (only part of the claim is supported)

5b. **Check for unquoted verbatim phrases:** While the PDF text is in hand, also scan the manuscript sentence(s) surrounding this citation for word-for-word borrowing from the source that is not enclosed in quotation marks. A run of 5 or more consecutive words appearing identically in both texts is a strong signal; 4 words is worth flagging if the phrasing is distinctive (e.g. a notable characterisation like "notoriously difficult").

   ```python
   import re

   def ngrams(text, n):
       words = re.findall(r'\b\w+\b', text.lower())
       return [tuple(words[i:i+n]) for i in range(len(words) - n + 1)]

   manuscript_context = # the 1-3 sentences around the citation in the manuscript
   pdf_text = # full PDF text

   for n in (6, 5, 4):
       ms_grams = set(ngrams(manuscript_context, n))
       pdf_grams = set(ngrams(pdf_text, n))
       matches = ms_grams & pdf_grams
       if matches:
           # reconstruct matched phrase and check it isn't already in quotes
           for gram in matches:
               phrase = ' '.join(gram)
               # check manuscript context for surrounding quote marks
               pattern = r'["\u201c\u201d\u2018\u2019][^"]*' + re.escape(phrase)
               if not re.search(pattern, manuscript_context.lower()):
                   flag_unquoted(phrase, manuscript_context)
   ```

   Flag any match with the verdict **⚠ Unquoted verbatim phrase** and report:
   - The matched phrase
   - The original sentence in the manuscript
   - The source sentence from the PDF
   - A suggested fix: either wrap in quotation marks and add a page reference, or paraphrase

   Report format:

   ```
   ⚠ Unquoted verbatim phrase — Smith et al. 2020

   Manuscript: "...measuring biodiversity is notoriously difficult and expensive..."
   Source:     "...measuring biodiversity is notoriously difficult in all fields..."

   Matched phrase: "measuring biodiversity is notoriously difficult"

   Fix: Either quote directly — 'measuring biodiversity is "notoriously difficult"
   (Marshall et al. 2020, p. X)' — or paraphrase to make the wording clearly your own.
   ```

6. **Missing PDFs:** Before flagging a paper as absent, always: (a) search Zotero using variant spellings, partial author names, and keywords from the title; (b) check the manuscript's full reference list (which may be in a separate document if the PDF says "reference list located elsewhere") for the complete citation details, then re-search. Only flag as "PDF not found in library" after both steps have been attempted. When flagging, include the full reference entry from the reference list so the user can verify.

7. **Web fallback for missing PDFs:** If a PDF is not found in Zotero after step 6, attempt to retrieve the source from the web using the DOI or URL recorded in the reference list entry. Use the WebFetch tool with the DOI URL (e.g., `https://doi.org/10.xxxx/xxxxx`) or the direct URL if one is given. If the fetch succeeds, treat the retrieved content as the source for claim verification and proceed with the usual faithfulness check. If the fetch is blocked by the network proxy (`EGRESS_BLOCKED` error), record this explicitly and note: "PDF not in Zotero; web access blocked — claim could not be independently verified. Reference entry: [full citation]." In either case (success or blocked), include the full reference list entry in the report. **Never silently skip verification for a missing PDF** — always report what was attempted and what was found.

### Output Format

For each citation, report:

```
[Citation ID] Smith et al. 2020

Claim: "Biodiversity loss is accelerating globally (Smith et al. 2020)."

Verdict: ✓ Faithful
Source passage: "Our analysis shows accelerating declines in species richness 
across terrestrial and marine ecosystems over the past two decades."

Confidence: High (exact match to claim)

---
```

Alternatively for overstatement:

```
[Citation ID] Jones 2019

Claim: "All temperate forests show declining productivity (Jones 2019)."

Verdict: ⚠ Overstated
Source passage: "Productivity declines were observed in 68% of sampled 
temperate forests in North America."

Issue: The manuscript claims universality; the source reports 68% prevalence. 
Suggest: "Most temperate forests show declining productivity (Jones 2019)."

```

## Stage 2: Citation Gap Detection (Semantic)

> Calls `litmap search` against the user's local embeddings database. Requires Claude Code runtime — see banner above.

### Input
- Manuscript (docx, pdf, or pasted text)
- Reference list built in Stage 1
- User's Zotero library (read via the zotero skill)
- (Optional) `--collection` scope if the user named one

### Procedure

1. **Identify unsupported claims.** Scan the manuscript for empirical or theoretical assertions that lack an in-text citation. Build a list of records:

    ```
    {claim_text, sentence_context, section_heading}
    ```

    where `sentence_context` is the claim's sentence plus the one preceding sentence (for query disambiguation).

2. **(Optional, ≥30 unique citations only) Up-front cluster overview.**

    ```bash
    uv run --project ~/src/Cowork/litmap litmap cluster \
      --manuscript <manuscript_path> \
      --output /tmp/audit_clusters \
      --format md
    ```

    Read `/tmp/audit_clusters.md` and present the thematic outline before per-claim analysis. The user can use this to spot whole topic areas that are over- or under-cited.

3. **Per-claim semantic search.** For each unsupported-claim record, use LanceDB to perform a semantic search. You will need to query LM Studio first to get the embedding vector for the claim:

    ```python
    import lancedb
    db = lancedb.connect("~/.omnimind/lancedb")
    table = db.open_table("chunks")
    # Fetch embedding from LM Studio http://localhost:1234/v1/embeddings
    # Then query LanceDB:
    results = table.search(query_vector).where("source = 'zotero'").limit(5).to_list()
    ```

4. **Filter candidates.**
    - Drop any candidate already cited in the manuscript (compare DOI first, then `lastname year` against the Stage 1 reference list).
    - Drop any candidate with `similarity < 0.75` — below that threshold the match is usually too weak to be useful.
    - Keep at most 3 candidates per claim.

5. **Present the report.** For each unsupported claim:

    ```markdown
    ### Section 3.2 — claim text excerpt
    > "<the claim sentence>"

    Suggested citations from your library (similarity, zotero_key):
    1. **0.87** — Valavi et al. 2022, *Predictive performance of presence-only SDMs* (`AAAA0001`)
       DOI: 10.1111/geb.13476
    2. **0.81** — Norberg 2019, *A comprehensive evaluation of predictive performance...* (`AAAA0042`)
    ```

    If no candidates clear the threshold, write plainly:
    > "No semantically similar papers in your library. Consider broader literature search outside the local Zotero collection."

### Failure modes

- **Cluster step fails**: skip silently, proceed to per-claim search.
- **LanceDB unavailable**: Make sure you are passing the correct database path `~/.omnimind/lancedb`.

## Stage 3: Logical Consistency Check

### Input
- The manuscript (full text)
- Citation audit and gap analysis from Stages 1–2

### Process

1. **Extract key claims:** Scan the manuscript section-by-section and list major claims:
   - Research questions and hypotheses
   - Assertions about the state of knowledge (e.g., "X is understudied")
   - Methodological choices and their justifications
   - Results and interpretations
   - Implications and future directions

2. **Check for contradictions:** 
   - Do any two claims directly contradict each other?
   - Are terms used inconsistently (e.g., "biodiversity" defined one way in intro, used differently in discussion)?
   - Are definitions circular or vague?

3. **Check for reasoning gaps:**
   - Are logical leaps made without justification? (e.g., "Study X found Y; therefore Z" without connecting Y to Z)
   - Does the conclusion follow from the results?
   - Are assumptions stated explicitly?
   - Is the scope of claims matched to the scope of evidence?

4. **Check for scope creep:**
   - Are generalizations overstated? (e.g., "This study of 10 species shows that...")
   - Are causal claims made where only correlations are shown?
   - Are statements qualified appropriately? (e.g., "may," "likely," "in this region")

5. **Flag undefined or under-defined terms:**
   - Are key concepts (e.g., "resilience," "ecosystem services") defined before use?
   - Are acronyms introduced before first use?

### Output Format

```
**Contradiction detected** (Abstract vs. Introduction)

Abstract: "Remote sensing cannot reliably measure forest biomass."
Introduction: "High-resolution satellite data enable accurate biomass estimation."

Recommendation: Clarify the distinction (e.g., "passive optical remote sensing 
cannot reliably measure biomass; active LiDAR-based approaches are more 
promising").

---

**Reasoning gap** (Methods → Results)

Methods: "We used species occurrence data from iNaturalist."
Results: "Species richness patterns aligned with predictions."

Issue: The connection between iNaturalist (which is spatially biased toward 
populated areas) and richness predictions is not established. Does this 
bias affect the conclusions?

Recommendation: Add a limitations paragraph addressing data bias.

---

**Scope creep** (Results → Discussion)

Results: "In our 10-site study, SDM accuracy was 0.82 AUC."
Discussion: "Deep learning SDMs are highly accurate for predicting global 
species distributions."

Issue: Results from 10 sites do not support a global claim.

Recommendation: Qualify: "Our results suggest that deep learning SDMs may 
achieve high accuracy; further validation across diverse regions is needed."

---
```

---

## Stage 4: Copyediting Pass

### Input
- The full manuscript

### Process

1. **Grammar & mechanics:**
   - Subject-verb agreement
   - Tense consistency (past for completed work, present for established facts)
   - Pronoun reference clarity
   - Active vs. passive voice (prefer active where possible, but passive acceptable in methods)

2. **Clarity & concision:**
   - Wordy phrases (e.g., "in order to" → "to", "due to the fact that" → "because")
   - Unclear pronoun antecedents
   - Overly complex sentences (break into 2–3 shorter sentences if needed)
   - Jargon without definition

3. **Flow & transitions:**
   - Do paragraphs flow logically?
   - Are transitions between sections smooth?
   - Do topic sentences align with paragraph content?

4. **Style & consistency:**
   - Parallel structure in lists or comparisons
   - Consistent capitalization and formatting
   - Consistent citation style (author-year format; check for mixed styles)
   - Number formatting (spell out <10; numerals ≥10; exception: start of sentence)

5. **Common scientific writing issues:**
   - Hedging (excessive "may," "might," "could" — use sparingly and intentionally)
   - Present perfect tense misuse (e.g., "Studies have shown that X" — who? when?)
   - "Data" as singular (data is plural; use "datasets" or "data points" for singular)
   - Abbreviations introduced but not used; or used before introduction

6. **Sentence-level revisions:** Provide before/after examples.

### Output Format

```
**Grammar issue** (Page 3, Results)

Original: "The results shows that deep learning models performs better 
than traditional SDMs."

Corrected: "The results show that deep learning models perform better 
than traditional SDMs."

Issue: Subject-verb agreement (plural "results" requires "show" and "perform").

---

**Clarity issue** (Page 1, Abstract)

Original: "We used remote sensing and machine learning, which is a powerful 
combination for predicting species distributions."

Revised: "We combined remote sensing with machine learning to predict 
species distributions with high accuracy."

Issue: "which is a powerful combination" is vague and wordy. The revision 
is more direct and specific.

---

**Flow issue** (Page 5, Discussion, para. 2)

Original: [Three sentences about climate change] [Abrupt shift] [One sentence 
about policy implications]

Revised: Add a transition: "These findings have important implications for 
conservation policy..." before the policy sentence.

---

**Style issue** (Inconsistent number formatting)

Original: "We sampled 10 sites across 3 regions in 4 years."

Check: Are numbers <10 and ≥10 formatted consistently? Should be either: 
"We sampled ten sites across three regions in four years" (spell out all <10) 
OR "We sampled 10 sites across 3 regions in 4 years" (numerals for all). 
Pick one and apply throughout.

```

## Integration & Output

Run all four stages in sequence. Deliver:

1. **Annotated manuscript** with inline comments (via track changes or comment blocks)
2. **Summary report** listing:
   - **Citation audit:** # faithful, # overstated, # unsupported, # missing PDFs
   - **Citation gaps:** # claims without support, # suggested citations
   - **Logical issues:** # contradictions, # reasoning gaps, # scope creep, # undefined terms
   - **Copyediting:** # grammar issues, # clarity issues, # style issues

3. **Prioritized revision checklist** (must-fix vs. nice-to-fix) so the user can tackle the most important issues first.

---

## Dependencies

- **zotero skill** — to query the Zotero library and retrieve PDFs
- **pdf-reading skill** — to extract text from PDFs and verify claims
- **file-reading skill** (if docx/pdf uploaded) — to read the manuscript
- Standard regex and text processing (built-in)

---

## Workflow Notes

- **Timing:** Expect 10–20 minutes for an 8,000-word manuscript, depending on citation count and PDF availability.
- **Zotero integration:** Assumes Doug's Zotero library is accessible at `/mnt/Zotero/` (Cowork environment) or via the zotero skill.
- **Citation format:** Works with author-year citations (Smith 2020, Jones et al. 2019). Numbered citations [1], [2] require different parsing; confirm format before beginning.
- **Tone:** Citations and logical consistency feedback should be constructive and specific; copyediting suggestions should include examples and rationales.
- **Scope:** Focuses on peer-review readiness, not format compliance. For journal-specific formatting (e.g., Nature, Ecology Letters), recommend consulting target journal's author guidelines after audit.
